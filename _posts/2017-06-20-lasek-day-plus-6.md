Navigating the city while blurry is harder than I thought. 
Today I was on site at my client's 
and I completely missed 
when I should get off the express bus.

Writing code required 18pt fonts. 
Fortunately, large portions of the day were spent speaking with the larger team.

Somehow, I could see enough for ping pong while taking a break. 
I can't tell if the whiffing my smashes was more due to lack of practice or lack of eyesight.

Tomorrow will be better.
