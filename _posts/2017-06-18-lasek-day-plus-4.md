4th day post laser eye surgery. I tried to put on my glasses again this morning

It "feels" like my eyes are 20/50. There's no prescription left to correct, but with the way the epithelium (skin) of the eyes is healing, the world is still blurry. I thought that I would have recovered more than I have right now.

I also have a bandage contact lens in each eye. My brain hasn't fully cottoned onto the fact that these are my eyes now. It still feels like these contact lenses are doing the correction.
