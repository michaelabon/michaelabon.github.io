Major mods
==========

These are game-changing and I can’t live without them. 
Read the README, for sure, because they contain a lot.

[Traffic Manager: President Edition](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=583429740)
------------------------------------

This is huge. 
C:S was originally a traffic sim.
You can 
configure lane changes, 
remove traffic lights, 
establish priority or speed limits, 
or even more manual stuff like timing adjacent lights.
Super useful when trying to solve traffic problems.

[Fine Road Anarchy 2](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1844440354)
---------------------

When building roads, 
toggle off limitations like slope, height, collisions. 
Prevent a segment from bending. 
Get closer to other roads without snapping, 
turn off any collisions.

Works well with...

[Fine Road Tool 2](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1844442251)
------------------

When building roads, 
have much more granular elevation steps, 
build sunken roads and terraformed ramps, 
force an elevated road instead of a bridge, 
build curved bridges, 
build above ground tunnels, 
and more.

The two Fine Road tools will integrate together.

[Ploppable RICO](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=586012417)
----------------

Sometimes you want a specific building in a specific spot. 
This gives you the power to not just paint with zones, 
but also to plop any specific residential, industrial, commercial, or office building.

Works really well with custom assets!

Assets
======

I won’t offer many of these, 
because 1) there are SO MANY available, 
and 2) you should find what fits in your city’s look and feel.

[Ultimate Skyscraper Collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409510305)
--------------------------------

Cities look better with big big buildings. 
This links to a Mod Collection that contains 40 other real-life and fictional skyscrapers.

Minor Mods
==========

These have lower learning curves. 
They don’t need a big README.

[Roundabout Builder](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1625704117)
--------------------

Convert any intersection into a roundabout. 
Not the most robust of mods, but still handy.

[Network Extensions 2](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=812125426)
----------------------

Adds more road types: roads with turning lanes, bus lanes, asymmetrical (like 2+1 lanes).

[Move-it](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1619685021)
---------

Just move anything. 
Buildings, trees, roads, pesky support pillars for overpasses. 
Get them where you want them rather than them snapping to a grid.

[Automatic Bulldoze](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1507233911)
--------------------

Whenever you have an abandoned building, 
it drags down the property value of the surrounding buildings,
which makes them more likely to become abandoned too. 
You _can_ go through and manually bulldoze an abandoned building
when you notice them, 
but this extension just automatically bulldozes them for you.

[Extra Landscaping Tools](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=502750307)
-------------------------

Tired of placing trees one at a time? 
This gives you a tree paintbrush so you can easily in-fill your freeway overpasses,
as well as an improved terraforming and water tool.
hen you notice them, but this extension just automatically bulldozes them for you.
