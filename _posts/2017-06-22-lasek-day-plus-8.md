I'm no longer wearing the bandage contact lenses.
I'm officially at 20/50 vision.
Next week will be 20/40.
Eyes are looking healthy

The BCL had meant that
my brain has been "tricked" this past week into thinking
that my vision was being corrected artificially.
Today was the first day
where I dealt with the cognitive load
that these are just my eyeballs. Nothing else.
It was a weird, pleasant sensation.
