I had my one month LASEK followup today.
I still have some combination of triple vision and frosted glass
when I'm looking at computer monitor distance. I dont see crisp edges.
But It's 20/40 vision, compared to my original 20/500.

So, the fellow wants me to come in again&mdash;next week&mdash;when the surgeon is back from vacation.
I think they want to talk about a correction surgery.
Which is normal.
Like, ~10% of people who started out with my vision have to be corrected.
And my &ndash;6.25 in both eyes had put me on the edge of what's possible.

But I'm really scared that I've permanently ruined my eyes.

I can totally function without any external correction.
I can navigate my way around the city.
I can work.
It's great.

I went to a soccer match at Yankee stadium,
enjoyed it fully,
but couldn't see which player was which.
Neither their jerseys nor their faces were distinguishable.
