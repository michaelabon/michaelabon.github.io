Interested in playing board games with me virtually? Here's stuff that I have access to.

**7 Wonders Duel (2)**
Head to head version of 7 Wonders, where you draft cards to build the best ancient wonder

**A Fake Artist Goes to New York (5-8)**
Everybody collectively draws a picture, one line at a time. One person gets a blank instruction card instead, and has to fool everyone else

**Azul (2-4)**
Gorgeous tile work. You choose coloured tiles, turn by turn, aiming to complete sets and patterns

**Camel Up! (4-8) (personal fav)**
Betting on camels racing, and influencing the race

**Carcassone (2-6)**
Shape the medieval landscape of France, claiming cities, monasteries and farms.

**Codenames (4-8)**
Word game, try to get your team mates to guess certain words but not others, by giving them one-word clues

**Dominion (2-6)**
Drafting, the game. Build the best deck over time.

**Ex Libris (2-4)**
You're all gnomish book collectors, vying to be head librarian by putting together the best library (in alphabetical order!)

**King of Tokyo (3-6)**
Yahtzee, but head-to-head. Giant kaiju battle it out to be the last one standing

**Manila (3-5)**
Craps, the board game. Bet on whether or not three ships will make it into harbour, and influence the race

**Mysterium (3-7)**
Co-op, one person is dead and communicates to the others via gorgeous watercolour cards, recreate the weapon, place, and murderer

**Root (3-6)**
Decide the fate of the forest as woodland factions fight for contrasting goals.

**Scythe (3-5)**
 Five factions vie for dominance in a war-torn, mech-filled, dieselpunk 1920s Europe.

**Spirit Island (1-4)**
 Island Spirits join forces using elemental powers to defend their home from invaders.

**Splendor (2-4)**
Renaissance merchants race to grab gems, acquire property, and please nobility.

**Suburbia (2-5)**
Expand your meager neighborhood into a sprawling suburb to attract the most citizens

**Settlers of Catan (3-6)**
 Collect and trade resources to build up the island of Catan in this modern classic.

**Taboo (4-8)**
Get your team to guess the target but you can't use the most obvious clues.

**Tokaido (2-5)**
Travel the famed Tokaido road, visit hot springs, try new food, and paint landscapes

**Twilight Imperium IV (this is a joke)**
Build an intergalactic empire through trade, research, conquest and grand politics.

**Wingspan**
Attract a beautiful and diverse collection of birds to your wildlife reserve.
