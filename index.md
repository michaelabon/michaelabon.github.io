Hello!
======

I'm a professional problem solver.
Sometimes I solve software engineering problems.
Sometimes I solve people problems.
It turns out that "engineering" problems are often just people problems in disguise.

This site is largely just notes to future me.
If you're interested in them, that's great, too.
[Hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/MrMichaelAbon) if you want to talk about any of these.
